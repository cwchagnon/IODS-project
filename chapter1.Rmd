# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*

*This is Intro to Open Data Science. It would seem to teach us about using R and opensource datasets. It's alright, thus far, though there's plenty I'm still unclear on.*
