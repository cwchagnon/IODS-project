```{r child = "chapter1.Rmd"}

#This is incredibly frustrating. I don't know why my first chapter did not upload. I don't know if my second chapter will upload. I don't know why random errors pop up when I use the EXACT SAME CODE that works on the class page.
```

```{r child = "chapter2.Rmd"}
#So, again, no clue if this will actually work. I feel like I'm learning, but also I feel like as soon as it seems I'm getting a handle on things, it all falls apart. Just really hoping this homework uploads correctly.
